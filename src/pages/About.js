              <h5><u>About Me:</u></h5>
              I am a rising third year at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science and Data Science. 
              I am exploring around the different aspects of CS - software engineering (full-stack), data science, UX design - and hope to learn 
              even more through IBM Accelerate!
              <br></br> <br></br>

              <h5><u>Interests:</u></h5>
              I enjoy playing the violin, listening to music (mostly soft/acoustics), cooking, and playing sudoku. 
              I also love spending time with my family - talking, taking walks, and watching feel-good shows/movies! <br></br> <br></br>

              <h5><u>Fun Facts:</u></h5> <ul>
                <li>I have been playing the violin for more than half of my life! </li>
                <li>My MBTI is INFJ (the rarest personality type in the world!) and my enneagram is type 1</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
